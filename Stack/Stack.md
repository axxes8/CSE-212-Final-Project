## What is a Stack?
A stack is a data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are to be performed. The order is primarily refered to as *"Last in, First Out"* or *"LIFO"*. The stack can be used to complete many different tasks, and in this tutorial will be implemented with a python list.

## Using a Stack
To explain how a stack works, we will be using the example of a stack of plates at a buffet line. When you want to add a plate to the stack, you are only able to add them to the top of the stack. If you want to take away a plate, you can only remove them from the top.

A stack in Python works much the same way. Adding to the back of the stack is called a **Push**. Removing from the back of the stack is called a **Pop**. Normally you do not push or pop from the middle of the stack as it is not as efficient as working from the back.
