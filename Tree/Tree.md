## What is a Tree?

A **Tree** is a lot like the linked list we learned about in the previous tutorial. However, one difference in a tree is that each node can link to multiple other nodes. In this tutorial we will learn about three different trees: **Binary Tree**, **Binary Search Tree**, and **Balanced Binary Search Tree**.
